# osu-score-thing
heavily inspired by https://github.com/Entrivax/osu-profile, made in electron for cross-platform compatibility and also, because im noob.
the code is really messy as i have like almost no experience in this at all, so expect crashes to happen.

you can find text files for every stat in your Documents folder (or home folder on linux) for use in OBS or elsewhere.
